Quoted content (verbatim):
“We were delisted citing volume and liquidity when they far exceeded the requirements stated in the delist notice.

We are aware of other projects being offered similar 'marketing' packages to stay listed to remove the ST tag which is not inline with the messaging of the delist notice either.

They also forfeited certain deposits that were made to them that came from the shielded pool even when the user could prove it came from them and was just asking for them to be returned. They could have prevented this if they used Exchange Addresses but chose not to implement anything and continue forfeiting balances.”

Context and relevance:
- Pattern of conduct: Alleges offers of paid “marketing” packages to remove ST tag, mirroring quid‑pro‑quo demands.
- Listing policy inconsistencies: Claims delisting despite meeting stated volume/liquidity requirements.
- Deposits/withdrawals handling: Alleges forfeiture of user deposits originating from shielded pool despite proof of origin; suggests the use of exchange addresses could have prevented such forfeiture.
