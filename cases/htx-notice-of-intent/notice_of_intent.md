Date (UTC, ISO 8601): 2025-09-18T00:00:00Z

To: HTX Technology Holdings Limited and its affiliates (the “Respondent”)  
From: Ergo Foundation (the “Claimant”), a Singapore-based entity  
Attention: Legal/Compliance

Dear Sir or Madam:

This letter serves as a formal pre‑action notice on behalf of the Ergo Foundation (the “Claimant”), a Singapore‑based entity, to formally notify HTX Technology Holdings Limited and its affiliates (the “Respondent”) of the Claimant’s intention to initiate legal proceedings in the courts of Singapore. These proceedings will arise from serious violations of our contractual relationship and related unlawful conduct, including attempted bribery and extortion.

---

## Summary of Claims

The Ergo Foundation entered into a contractual relationship with HTX for the listing of the ERG token. The Respondent has materially breached the Agreement and engaged in unlawful conduct as follows:

### 1. Breach of Contract

The Respondent’s actions constitute fundamental repudiatory breaches under the Agreement and Singapore law.

- Breach of Listing Conditions: The executed contract for the ERG token listing specified no benchmark or performance conditions related to trading volume or liquidity. Despite this, HTX retroactively imposed a new, arbitrary minimum daily trading volume of USD 50,000 as a condition for retaining the listing. This constitutes a fundamental breach of the Agreement.
- Failure to Provide Official Notice: The Respondent failed to provide official notice of a “Special Treatment” (ST) tag or a pending delisting via formal channels. The Respondent’s representative, “Jacky,” communicated these critical notices solely through an unofficial Telegram channel, which is not legally recognized as formal notification. The Respondent’s claim that a warning email was sent on 2025‑08‑06 is disputed and, even if sent, it was directed to a generic email address rather than the designated, legally‑defined point of contact.
- Discriminatory and Arbitrary Enforcement of Rules: The Respondent’s application of token management rules is inconsistent and discriminatory. As documented, HTX has permitted other tokens with trading volumes far below the newly imposed USD 50,000 threshold to remain listed without an ST tag. This selective enforcement and lack of a clear, published policy applied equally to all listed assets further demonstrates a breach of good faith.

### 2. Attempted Bribery and Extortion

The Respondent’s representatives have engaged in impermissible attempts to extort the Ergo Foundation for financial gain in exchange for continued listing. These actions are a clear breach of the Agreement’s good faith obligations and may amount to criminal offenses under Singapore’s Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA).

- Extortion for Continued Listing: A representative of the Respondent privately informed that HTX would reverse the delisting decision in exchange for a payment. This was first framed as a USD 30,000 “trading competition” fee, then later revised to a direct “payment to avoid delisting,” with the implication that the amount was negotiable.
- Abuse of Position: This conduct—including the private offer of a payment to avert delisting—constitutes an abuse of the Respondent’s market position and an attempted quid‑pro‑quo transaction. It is a direct attempt to compel the Ergo Foundation to make a payment outside the terms of the signed contract.

The Claimant has collected substantial evidence, including chat logs and screenshots of these impermissible attempts, which will be submitted as evidence in the forthcoming legal proceedings. See exhibits: cases/htx-notice-of-intent/evidence/Lei_qx/messages.html and cases/htx-notice-of-intent/evidence/Lei_qx/result.json, summarized at cases/htx-notice-of-intent/evidence/lei_qx_summary.md.

As a direct result of the Respondent’s conduct, the Ergo Foundation has suffered losses estimated at no less than USD 450,000. The Claimant reserves the right to seek additional damages, including punitive damages, interest, and costs, as further evidence of wrongdoing may emerge.

### 3. Additional Allegations and Context

- Allegations regarding user deposits and withdrawals: The Claimant has received reports alleging withdrawal interruptions, holds, or unauthorized deductions affecting user deposits. The Claimant seeks full transactional logs, internal explanations, and remediation. Particulars will be provided and substantiated with evidence.
- Marketing and retention performance: HTX-provided marketing/listing promotion was low-retention and yielded negligible conversion relative to representations; any reliance on such metrics to justify delisting is disputed and will be evidenced.
- Support and communications failures: Support responsiveness has been inadequate; the Respondent failed to use the designated legal contact and relied on unofficial Telegram channels for critical notices. This conduct is inconsistent with professional standards and formal notice requirements.
- Breach of good faith: The Respondent’s unilateral retroactive terms, selective enforcement, and quid‑pro‑quo demands are inconsistent with the duty of good faith and fair dealing under Singapore law.
- The Claimant will supplement particulars with exhibits, chat logs, and affidavits as required.

### Third‑party context

The Claimant also notes public statements by Firo ($FIRO) alleging: (i) delisting despite exceeding stated volume/liquidity requirements; (ii) offers of paid “marketing” packages to remove the ST tag; and (iii) forfeiture of user deposits originating from a shielded pool despite proof of origin, which FIRO contends could have been avoided by using exchange addresses. These statements are cited to illustrate an alleged broader pattern of conduct relevant to the issues raised herein. See exhibit: cases/htx-notice-of-intent/evidence/firo_statement.md (add durable link and timestamp).

## Demand for Remedy

To avoid litigation, HTX must, within 30 days of the receipt of this letter, take the following actions:

- Provide Full Restitution: Provide full restitution for the documented losses totaling at least USD 450,000, representing the initial listing fee.
- Reverse Delisting Decision: Publicly announce the reversal of the delisting decision for ERG and remove the ST label from the token on the exchange.
- Cease Improper Communications and Disclose Details: Immediately cease all improper communications; provide details of the attempted bribery and extortion, including the names of all involved parties; and cooperate fully with any investigations.
- Confirm No Retaliation: Confirm in writing that no retaliatory actions will be taken against the Ergo Foundation’s accounts or assets.

Failure to comply will result in the Claimant proceeding with legal action without further notice, seeking all available remedies, including injunctive relief. The Claimant will also report this matter to relevant authorities, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC), and international anti‑corruption bodies, supported by the collected evidence.

This letter is sent without prejudice to the Claimant’s rights and remedies. The Ergo Foundation invites HTX to engage in good‑faith discussions to resolve this matter amicably.

Sincerely,
