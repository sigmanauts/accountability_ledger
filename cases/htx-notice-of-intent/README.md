## Summary
Pre‚Äëaction notice by the Ergo Foundation (Singapore‚Äëbased) to HTX Technology Holdings Limited and affiliates (HTX), alleging:
- Breach of contract: Retroactive imposition of a USD 50,000/day volume requirement despite no such benchmark in the executed listing agreement; discriminatory/arbitrary enforcement against ERG compared to other lower‚Äëvolume tokens; failure to use formal notice channels (Telegram ‚ÄúJacky‚Äù used; disputed generic email on 2025‚Äë08‚Äë06 not sent to the designated legal contact).
- Attempted bribery/extortion: Payment solicited to reverse delisting‚Äîfirst as a USD 30,000 ‚Äútrading competition‚Äù fee, later as a direct payment to avoid delisting‚Äîcontrary to good faith obligations and potentially in breach of Singapore‚Äôs Prevention of Corruption Act.
- Deposits/withdrawals: Reports of withdrawal interruptions/holds or unauthorized deductions affecting user deposits; request for full transactional logs, explanations, and remediation.
- Marketing/retention: HTX‚Äëprovided promotion allegedly low‚Äëretention with negligible conversion versus representations; reliance on these metrics to justify delisting is disputed.
- Support/good faith: Inadequate support responsiveness and use of unofficial channels for critical notices; overall conduct inconsistent with the duty of good faith and fair dealing.

Remedy demanded within 30 days: restitution (‚â• USD 450,000), reversal of delisting and removal of ST, cessation of improper communications, disclosure of involved parties, and non‚Äëretaliation. Failing that, the Foundation indicates intent to proceed in Singapore courts and notify MAS, SFC, and international anti‚Äëcorruption bodies.
