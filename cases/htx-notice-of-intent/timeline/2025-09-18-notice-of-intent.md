  - htx
claims:
  - Breach of listing conditions: Contract specified no volume/liquidity benchmarks; HTX later imposed a USD 50,000/day minimum to retain listing.
  - Failure to provide official notice: ST tag/pending delisting communicated via Telegram by “Jacky”; disputed generic email on 2025-08-06; not the designated legal contact.
  - Discriminatory and arbitrary enforcement: other tokens below the USD 50,000 threshold remained listed without ST, indicating inconsistent application of rules and lack of good faith.
  - Attempted bribery/extortion: payment demanded to reverse delisting; framed as a USD 30,000 “trading competition” then as a direct “payment to avoid delisting.”
  - Allegations regarding user deposits/withdrawals: reports of withdrawal interruptions, holds, or unauthorized deductions affecting user deposits; request for full transactional logs and remediation.
  - Low-retention marketing/performance: HTX-provided marketing/listing promotion allegedly yielded low retention and negligible conversion versus representations; reliance on such metrics to justify delisting is disputed.
  - Support and good faith: inadequate support responsiveness; failure to use designated legal contact; use of unofficial Telegram for critical notices; breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing.
  - Remedy demand (30 days): restitution of at least USD 450,000; reverse delisting and remove ST; cease improper communications; disclose involved parties; confirm non-retaliation.
  - If unmet: intent to proceed in Singapore courts and notify MAS, SFC, and international anti-corruption bodies.
