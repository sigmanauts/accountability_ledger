# Governance

- Use Issues for discussion and triage.
- Use Pull Requests for new evidence and updates.
- Keep an audit trail through git history.
- Tag maintainers for any urgent matter.

Decisions are made through review in Pull Requests. Maintainers may request adjustments to protect privacy, improve provenance, or ensure data quality. Contributors should follow the data standards, naming rules, and DCO sign-off requirements documented in this repository.
